              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-8">
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-semibold">Leverage Online Tools:</strong> Many grocery stores offer online platforms or apps that allow
                  you to browse their inventory and prices. Utilizing these tools enables you to compare prices from
                  the comfort of your home, ensuring you identify the best deals before setting foot in a store.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-semibold">Understand Unit Pricing:</strong> When comparing products, especially those in different-sized
                  packages, focus on the unit price (e.g., price per ounce or liter). This metric provides a true comparison
                  of value, helping you make informed decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-semibold">Be Flexible with Brands:</strong> Store brands or generic products often offer similar quality to
                  name brands but at a lower cost. Being open to these alternatives can lead to significant savings over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-semibold">Plan Your Shopping Trips:</strong> Timing can influence prices. Shopping during weekdays or in the
                  evenings might present opportunities to find discounted items, as stores often mark down products nearing
                  their sell-by dates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-semibold">Utilize Loyalty Programs:</strong> Many grocery stores offer loyalty programs that provide exclusive
                  discounts, coupons, or points that can be redeemed on future purchases. Signing up for these programs can
                  enhance your savings.
